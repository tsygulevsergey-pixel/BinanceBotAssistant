# Overview

This project is a professional-grade Binance USDT-M Futures Trading Bot engineered for high-performance trading, aiming for an 80%+ Win Rate and a Profit Factor of 1.8-2.5. It integrates advanced strategies, real-time market regime detection, sophisticated risk management, and an "Action Price" system based on Support/Resistance, Anchored VWAP, and price action. The bot operates in both Signals-Only and Live Trading Modes, with a strong focus on precise signal generation, dynamic entry/exit management, and robust performance tracking.

## Recent Changes (October 21, 2025)

### ðŸ”— V3 ZONES INTEGRATION: Break & Retest Strategy âœ… IMPLEMENTED

**Professional S/R Zones for Break & Retest:**
- **New Feature**: Break & Retest strategy now uses V3 professional S/R zones instead of primitive swing Â± ATR method
- **Shared Zones Provider** (`src/utils/v3_zones_provider.py`):
  - Singleton pattern for efficient zone caching across strategies
  - Prevents duplicate zone calculations
  - Shared access to V3 zones between Break & Retest and V3 S/R strategies
- **Enhanced Retest Zone Detection**:
  - **V3 Mode** (`use_v3_zones: true`): Uses DBSCAN-clustered zones with reaction validation and multi-TF confluence
  - **Classic Mode** (`use_v3_zones: false`): Fallback to original swing Â± 0.3 ATR method
  - Automatic zone quality filtering (minimum strength threshold configurable)
- **Score Bonuses for V3 Zones**:
  - **A-grade zones** (strength â‰¥80): +2.0 score bonus
  - **B-grade zones** (strength â‰¥70): +1.5 score bonus
  - **C-grade zones** (strength â‰¥60): +1.0 score bonus
  - **D-grade zones** (strength â‰¥50): +0.5 score bonus
  - **HTF zones bonus**: +1.0 (1D), +0.5 (4H) for higher timeframe zones
- **Config Options** (`config.yaml` â†’ `strategies.retest`):
  - `use_v3_zones`: true/false (default: true)
  - `v3_zone_strength_threshold`: 0-100 (default: 50, D-grade minimum)
- **Impact**: Significantly more accurate zone identification, filtering weak swing levels that caused false signals

### ðŸ”§ CRITICAL BUG FIXES: V3 S/R Strategy âœ… FIXED

**Issue 1: SHORT FlipRetest Zone Selection**
- **Problem**: SHORT signals had SL BELOW entry (wrong protection)
- **Root cause**: Used Support zones ('S') instead of Resistance zones ('R')
- **Fix**: Both LONG and SHORT now use Resistance zones correctly:
  - LONG: R zone broken UP â†’ retest from below â†’ SL below zone
  - SHORT: R zone broken DOWN â†’ retest from above â†’ SL above zone

**Issue 2: Confidence Score Calculation**
- **Problem**: 
  - Zone strength not used (read but ignored)
  - Double HTF bonuses (class + timeframe)
  - Fake VWAP bonus without actual check
- **Fix**: Complete rewrite of confidence formula:
  - **Base (0-50)**: zone_strength Ã— 0.5 (main quality factor)
  - **HTF bonus**: +20 (1D) / +15 (4H) / +10 (1H) - NO double counting
  - **Setup**: +10 (FlipRetest) / +5 (SweepReturn)
  - **A-grade**: +20 (high-quality sweeps)
  - **VWAP**: +5 (only if price actually aligned with bias)

**Issue 3: Zone Event Logging Errors**
- **Problem**:
  - Zones missing 'id' field â†’ zone_id='unknown'
  - Invalid timestamp conversion â†’ bar_timestamp='1970-01-01'
  - UNIQUE constraint violations in v3_sr_zone_events table
- **Fix**:
  - Added unique ID generation for all zones (format: "tf_kind_price")
  - Safe timestamp conversion with type checking and fallback
  - Duplicate event detection before database insert
  - Removed nanoseconds warning with .floor('S')

**Additional improvements:**
- Added nearest zones display in Telegram signals
- Diagnostic logging for PnL tracking
- Created check_v3_signals.py for database verification

### V3 Zone Events & Reaction Tracking System âœ… FULLY IMPLEMENTED
Complete real-time zone quality management system to prevent zone degradation:

**Zone Events Logging:**
- **Flip-Retest events**: body_break, flip (Râ‡„S switch), retest
- **Sweep-Return events**: sweep (with wick/body ratio), return
- Logged fields: event_type, touch_price, side, penetration_depth_atr, wick_to_body_ratio, market_regime, atr_value
- Automatic logging on every candle close for LONG/SHORT setups

**Reaction Tracking (Background Task - every 30 min):**
- Checks if price actually bounced after zone touches
- Updates: reaction_occurred, reaction_bars, reaction_magnitude_atr
- Validates zone effectiveness in real-time

**Auto Zone Strength Updates:**
- Weighted formula: Success rate (Â±20pts), Recency (Â±10pts), Reaction magnitude (+20pts), Touch penalty (-2pts after 5th)
- Integrated into zone builder: Every rebuild updates strength from events
- **Result**: Strong zones strengthen, weak zones degrade automatically

# User Preferences

- **Preferred communication style**: Simple, everyday language.
- **User runs bot locally on Windows PC in Ukraine** (not on Replit cloud)
- **Log files come from user's local computer** - when user attaches logs, they are from the bot running on their Windows machine
- **This Replit project contains the complete source code** - all code is here and kept up to date
- **Workflow setup is for Replit testing only** - user downloads code to run locally with his own API keys
- **When user shares logs or reports errors:**
    1. Logs are from their local Windows environment running Python bot
    2. They test/run the bot independently on their computer
    3. This Replit workspace is the source code repository
    4. Any fixes made here need to be downloaded by user to their local machine
