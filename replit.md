# Recent Changes

## Telegram Closed Signals Commands (October 15, 2025)
- **New Commands**: Added `/closed` and `/closed_ap` to show detailed list of closed signals
- **Features**:
  - `/closed [hours]` - Shows closed signals from main strategies (default 24h, max 20 signals)
  - `/closed_ap [hours]` - Shows closed Action Price signals (default 24h, max 20 signals)
  - Displays: Symbol, Direction (ðŸŸ¢/ðŸ”´), Exit Type (TP1/TP2/SL/BE/TIME_STOP), PnL%, Strategy/Pattern
  - Sorted by closed_at DESC (newest first)
  - Custom time range: `/closed 48` shows last 48 hours
- **Implementation**: Direct database queries to `signals` and `action_price_signals` tables
- **Files**: `src/telegram/bot.py` (lines 259-383, 40-41, 85-86, 108-109)

## Action Price Performance Tracker Statistics Fix (October 15, 2025)
- **Problem**: Statistics showed both TP1 and TP2 for same signal (e.g., signal hits TP2 â†’ both counters +1)
- **Root Cause**: Used `partial_exit_1_at/partial_exit_2_at` flags instead of `exit_reason` for counting
- **Solution**: Changed to count by `exit_reason` - mutually exclusive categories:
  - `exit_reason = 'TAKE_PROFIT_1'` â†’ TP1 counter
  - `exit_reason = 'TAKE_PROFIT_2'` â†’ TP2 counter
  - `exit_reason = 'BREAKEVEN'` â†’ Breakeven counter
- **Result**: Correct statistics - if TP2 hit, shows only TP2 (not both TP1+TP2)
- **Files**: `src/action_price/performance_tracker.py` (lines 465-467)

## Action Price Performance Tracker Fix v4 (October 15, 2025)
- **Problem**: Tracker works but shows wrong PnL for TP2 exits (e.g., -0.82% instead of profit)
- **Root Causes**: 
  1. Tracker used wrong logger (invisible in action_price logs) âœ… FIXED
  2. Timezone errors in time stop logic âœ… FIXED
  3. VWAP RuntimeWarning from pandas Timestamp/int âœ… FIXED
  4. Direction case mismatch in exit conditions: DB stores 'long'/'short' but code checks 'LONG'/'SHORT' âœ… FIXED
  5. Silent condition failures: No debug logs âœ… FIXED
  6. ZeroDivisionError after TP1: When SL moves to breakeven (SL=Entry), risk_r=0 â†’ crash in MFE/MAE calc âœ… FIXED
  7. **PnL calculation bug**: Forgot `.upper()` in `_calculate_total_pnl()` â†’ used wrong formula âœ… FIXED
- **Solution v4**: 
  - **Logger Fix**: Tracker uses ap_logger (visible in action_price logs)
  - **Timezone Fix**: Auto-localize naive datetime before comparison
  - **VWAP Fix**: Use numpy arrays instead of pandas Series
  - **Direction Fix**: Convert to uppercase with `.upper()` in ALL functions (_check_exit_conditions, _update_mfe_mae, _calculate_total_pnl)
  - **Debug Logs**: Added PnL calculation breakdown (TP1 30% + Remainder 70% = Total)
  - **Breakeven Protection**: Skip MFE/MAE update when risk_r < 0.0001 (prevents division by zero)
- **Result**: âœ… WORKING - Tracker closes signals correctly with accurate PnL calculations
- **Files**: `src/action_price/performance_tracker.py`, `src/indicators/vwap.py`

## Action Price Candle Selection Fix (October 15, 2025)
- **Problem**: Bot analyzed wrong candles (-3, -2) instead of last 2 closed (-2, -1), causing EMA200 mismatch with Binance
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded indices used -3/-2 instead of -2/-1 for initiator/confirmation
- **Additional Issues**: 
  - Timestamp in JSONL always showed "1970-01-01" (used DataFrame index instead of open_time column)
  - EMA200 values didn't match Binance because wrong candles were analyzed
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed to analyze last 2 closed candles: initiator=-2, confirmation=-1
  - Fixed timestamp to use `open_time` column instead of DataFrame index
- **Result**: Now analyzes correct candles with proper timestamps in logs
- **Files**: `src/action_price/engine.py` (lines 260-275, 700-709)

## Price Precision Fix for Action Price (October 15, 2025)
- **Problem**: Action Price signals showed rounded prices (0.0075 vs actual 0.0075281) - not matching Binance precision
- **Root Cause**: Telegram message formatting used fixed `.4f` format instead of Binance symbol precision
- **Solution**: Use `BinanceClient.format_price()` method which applies correct symbol-specific precision from exchange_info
- **Result**: Prices in signals now match Binance exactly (same decimal length)
- **Files**: `main.py` (lines 1401-1421)

## Semaphore Control for Parallel Updates (October 15, 2025)
- **Problem**: IP ban at 02:01:00 when 15m+1h candles closed - 580 tasks launched simultaneously via `asyncio.gather()` without limits
- **Root Cause**: `_parallel_update_candles()` created massive concurrent request queue (2700 weights vs 2400 limit)
- **Solution**: Added `asyncio.Semaphore(50)` to limit max 50 parallel tasks at once
- **Result**: Controlled request flow, prevents mass bursts at 00:00/02:00 when multiple timeframes close
- **Files**: `main.py` (lines 405-417)

## API Weight Calculation Fix (October 15, 2025)
- **Problem**: IP bans due to incorrect API weight calculations - RateLimiter underestimated request weights by 5-10x
- **Root Cause**: `get_klines()` and `get_depth()` used wrong weight boundaries (e.g., "1-100=1" instead of "1-99=1")
- **Solution**: Corrected weight formulas to match official Binance Futures API documentation:
  - **klines**: 1-99=1, 100-499=2, 500-1000=5, >1000=10
  - **depth**: 1-100=2, 101-500=5, 501-1000=10, 1001-5000=50
- **Result**: No IP bans, rate limiter syncing with Â±60-130 diff (normal range), verified with 60s production test
- **Files**: `src/binance/client.py` (lines 207-216, 241-250)

## VWAP RuntimeWarning Fix (October 15, 2025)
- **Fixed**: RuntimeWarning in VWAP calculations ("'<' not supported between instances of 'Timestamp' and 'int'")
- **Solution**: Added `pd.to_numeric()` conversion and explicit `.astype(float)` in `calculate_vwap_bands()` method
- **Result**: Clean execution, no warnings in production logs

## Data Stabilization Fix (October 14, 2025)
- **31-Second Delay**: Added 31-second delay after ANY candle close (15m/1h/4h/1d) before loading data from Binance
- **Problem Solved**: Bot was requesting data 6 seconds after candle close, receiving unstable/temporary prices that Binance updates 10-30 seconds later
- **Timeframe Coverage**: All four timeframes (15m/1h/4h/1d) properly detected and delayed
- **Timer Behavior**: TimeframeSync checks candle closes by real time BEFORE delay executes, maintaining accurate schedule (00:15/00:30/00:45/00:00)
- **Design**: Single consolidated delay per check cycle (efficient)

- **IP BAN Prevention v4**: Event-based coordination with single-log notification (no duplicate spam). All pending requests blocked immediately via ip_ban_event flag.
- **Periodic Gap Refill with Request Weight Calculator**: 
  - Pre-calculates total requests needed before execution
  - Respects 55% threshold with available capacity check
  - MIN_BATCH_SIZE: 50 requests minimum to start
  - FIFO ordering: First detected gaps sent first
  - Single batch: If total â‰¤ capacity, sends all at once
  - Multi-batch with wait: If total > capacity, splits and waits 60s for rate reset
