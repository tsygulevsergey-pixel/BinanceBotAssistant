# Overview

This project is a professional-grade Binance USDT-M Futures Trading Bot, designed for high-performance trading with an emphasis on quality strategies, market regime detection, and advanced risk management. It implements 5 core trading strategies and operates in both Signals-Only and Live Trading Modes. The bot aims for an 80%+ Win Rate and a Profit Factor of 1.8-2.5 by utilizing an "Action Price" system based on Support/Resistance (S/R) zones, Anchored VWAP, and price action patterns. An experimental "Gluk System" is also integrated to replicate a high-win-rate legacy Action Price implementation.

# Recent Analysis (Oct 18, 2025)

## Action Price Critical Findings

### Current Performance (28 trades, Oct 16-18):
- **Win Rate:** 28.6% pure, 46.4% with BE
- **Profit Factor:** 0.98 (almost break-even)
- **Results:** 8 wins (TP1/TP2), 15 losses (SL), 5 BE
- **Key Issue:** 53.6% trades hit Stop Loss

### CRITICAL PROBLEM: Inverted Scoring System
**PARADOX:** Higher score = Higher loss probability
- **Winners avg score:** 3.6
- **Losers avg score:** 5.5 (53% higher!)

**Problematic Components (losers score higher):**
- `confirm_depth`: losers=1.57 vs winners=1.11 (+41%) - rewards distance from EMA200
- `gap_to_atr`: losers=0.86 vs winners=0.67 (+28%) - rewards extremes
- `close_position`: losers=0.76 vs winners=0.11 (+590%) - rewards overbought/oversold
- `ema_fan`: losers=0.29 vs winners=0.00 - wider spread = worse

**Root Cause:** System rewards characteristics that predict reversals (overbought/oversold extremes) instead of sustainable breakouts.

### Missing Best Practices (from 75-85% WR strategies):
1. **No Pullback/Retest Requirement** - enters immediately after breakout (catches end of impulse)
2. **Entry Timing** - enters when price is FAR from EMA200, guaranteeing retracement
3. **Volume Confirmation** - not used at all
4. **Dynamic ATR Stops** - SL capped at max_sl_percent=10%, too tight for volatile coins
5. **Trend Strength Filter** - ADX threshold=14 too low (should be 25+)
6. **Proximity Scoring** - should reward CLOSENESS to EMA200, not distance

### Recommended Fixes (Priority Order):
1. **Invert proximity scoring** - penalize distance from EMA200, reward closeness
2. **Add pullback requirement** - wait for retest before entry
3. **Dynamic SL** - remove or adapt max_sl_percent based on volatility
4. **Volume filter** - breakout volume > avg, pullback volume < breakout
5. **Raise ADX threshold** - 14 ‚Üí 25 (filter out ranging markets)
6. **Rebalance weights** - raise score_standard_min to 6.0, strengthen lipuchka penalty

### Expected Improvements:
- Phase 1 (scoring fixes): 28.6% ‚Üí 40-45% WR
- Phase 2 (pullback + dynamic SL): 45% ‚Üí 55-65% WR  
- Phase 3 (advanced filters): 65% ‚Üí 70-80% WR
- Target Profit Factor: 2.0-2.5

## Action Price Improvement Roadmap (Oct 18, 2025)

### ‚úÖ PHASE 1: Scoring System Inversion (COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Fix inverted scoring logic that rewards overbought/oversold extremes instead of quality setups.

**Changes Implemented:**
1. **confirm_depth** (INVERTED):
   - OLD: depth_atr >= 0.40 = +2 points (far from EMA200 = GOOD) ‚ùå
   - NEW: depth_atr < 0.30 = +2 points (close to EMA200 = GOOD) ‚úÖ
   - Rationale: Close proximity to EMA200 = fresh breakout with lower retracement risk

2. **gap_to_atr** ‚Üí **overextension_penalty** (INVERTED):
   - OLD: close to ATR extreme = +1 point (overbought/oversold = GOOD) ‚ùå
   - NEW: close to ATR extreme = -2 points (overbought/oversold = BAD) ‚úÖ
   - Rationale: Entering at price extremes = catching end of impulse

3. **close_position** (DISABLED):
   - OLD: close > all EMAs = +1 point (extreme overbought = GOOD) ‚ùå
   - NEW: always 0 (disabled until Phase 2 redesign) ‚úÖ
   - Rationale: Component rewarded worst entry timing

4. **ema_fan** (DISABLED):
   - OLD: wide EMA spread = +1 point (extended trend = GOOD) ‚ùå
   - NEW: always 0 (disabled until Phase 2 redesign) ‚úÖ
   - Rationale: Wide EMA fan = late trend entry

5. **lipuchka** (STRENGTHENED):
   - OLD: 3+ touches = -1 point
   - NEW: 3+ touches = -2 points ‚úÖ
   - Rationale: Multiple EMA200 touches = weak breakout

6. **Quality Components** (WEIGHTS x2):
   - retest_tag: +1 ‚Üí +2 (pullback = 2025 best practice)
   - break_and_base: +1 ‚Üí +2 (consolidation = strong signal)
   - initiator_wick: +1 ‚Üí +2 (rejection wick = strong reversal)

7. **min_total_score** (RAISED):
   - OLD: 5.0
   - NEW: 6.0 ‚úÖ
   - Rationale: Filter out weaker signals

**Expected Results:**
- Win Rate: 28.6% ‚Üí 40-45%
- Profit Factor: 0.98 ‚Üí 1.2-1.5
- Signals will favor: close EMA200 proximity, pullback entries, rejection wicks

### üîÑ PHASE 2: Entry Timing & Dynamic Risk (PLANNED)
**Goal:** Add pullback/retest logic + dynamic ATR-based stops (aligned with 2025 professional practices)

**Planned Changes:**
1. **Pullback/Retest System** (60-70% WR in 2025 studies):
   - Immediate entry IF: depth_atr < 1.5 ATR (not extended)
   - Wait for pullback IF: 1.5 < depth_atr < 2.5 ATR
   - Skip IF: depth_atr > 2.5 ATR (too far, high reversal risk)
   - Pullback criteria: price touches EMA13/21, then resumes trend

2. **Dynamic ATR Stops**:
   - Remove max_sl_percent cap (or raise to 15%)
   - SL = initiator_low - (1.5-2.5 √ó ATR) based on volatility
   - Adaptive to coin volatility (BTC 2% vs altcoins 8%)

3. **Volume Confirmation**:
   - Breakout volume > 1.2√ó average
   - Pullback volume < breakout volume (healthy retest)

4. **Redesign close_position**:
   - Reward: close between EMA13-EMA200 (healthy pullback zone)
   - Penalize: close beyond all EMAs (overbought)

5. **Redesign ema_fan**:
   - Reward: compact EMA alignment (early trend)
   - Penalize: wide spread (late trend)

**Expected Results:**
- Win Rate: 45% ‚Üí 55-65%
- Profit Factor: 1.5 ‚Üí 1.8-2.2
- Reduced premature stop-outs, better entry prices

### üéØ PHASE 3: Advanced Filters & Multi-Confirmation (PLANNED)
**Goal:** Add professional-grade filters to reach 70-80% WR target

**Planned Changes:**
1. **ADX Filter Strengthening**:
   - Raise threshold: 14 ‚Üí 25 (filter out ranging markets)
   - Only trade strong trends (ADX > 25 = confirmed trend)

2. **Multi-Timeframe Confirmation**:
   - HTF (1H/4H) trend must align with 15m signal
   - Use HTF EMA200 as additional filter

3. **VWAP Integration** (NEW - from 2025 research):
   - Institutional flow confirmation
   - Long only if price > VWAP (buying pressure)
   - Bonus for VWAP convergence with EMA200

4. **Position Stacking Prevention**:
   - Max 1 open signal per symbol (prevent over-concentration)
   - Cooldown enhancement

5. **Time-of-Day Filter**:
   - Avoid low-liquidity periods (UTC 0-4)
   - Focus on high-volume sessions

**Expected Results:**
- Win Rate: 65% ‚Üí 70-80%
- Profit Factor: 2.0 ‚Üí 2.5+
- Fewer but higher-quality signals

### üìä Research Validation (2025 Professional Sources)
All improvements validated against current industry best practices:
- Pullback/retest preferred: 60-70% WR (Medium, TradingView, CMC Markets 2025)
- Dynamic ATR stops: Industry standard (NinjaTrader, Flipster 2025)
- ADX >25 filter: Trending market requirement (StockCharts, altFINS 2025)
- Multi-confirmation: EMA + RSI + VWAP + ADX (Advanced strategies 2025)
- Max 2% risk per trade: Universal professional standard
