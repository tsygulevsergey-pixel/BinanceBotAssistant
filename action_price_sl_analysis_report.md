# Action Price Stop-Loss Analysis Report

## Summary

**Finding: No stop-loss trades available for analysis yet.**

All 134 Action Price signals found in the JSONL logs are **still active** (not closed). None have reached their stop-loss, take-profit, or any other exit condition yet.

## Data Sources Checked

### 1. JSONL Signal Logs
- **Location**: `attached_assets/action_price_signals_*.jsonl`
- **Total Signals**: 134 signals
- **Status**: All have `exit_reason: null` (still active/pending)
- **Date Range**: October 12-15, 2025

### 2. SQLite Database
- **Location**: `data/trading_bot.db`
- **Table**: `action_price_signals`
- **Total Records**: 0
- **Finding**: Database is empty (no signals stored)

## Signal Structure Example

From the JSONL files, here's what a typical signal entry looks like:

```json
{
  "signal_id": "d664cca25d08f812",
  "symbol": "TRBUSDT",
  "direction": "short",
  "pattern": "body_cross",
  "mode": "SCALP",
  "score_total": 1,
  "entry_price": 25.812,
  "sl_price": 25.917597894628493,
  "tp1_price": 25.70640210537151,
  "exit_reason": null,    // ← Not closed yet
  "exit_price": null,
  "mfe_r": null,
  "mae_r": null
}
```

## Score Distribution (All Active Signals)

Based on the 134 active signals in JSONL files:

| Score Range | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| 0-3         | TBD   | TBD        |
| 3-4         | TBD   | TBD        |
| 4-5         | TBD   | TBD        |
| 5-6         | TBD   | TBD        |
| 6-7         | TBD   | TBD        |
| 7-10        | TBD   | TBD        |

*(Need to parse all JSONL files to get this data)*

## Why No Closed Signals?

Possible reasons:
1. **Bot Mode**: Running in signals-only mode (no actual trading)
2. **Recent Start**: Bot started recently, signals haven't had time to reach exit conditions
3. **Database Reset**: Database was cleared/reset at some point
4. **Performance Tracker Not Running**: The performance tracker may not be actively checking signals

## What's Needed for SL Analysis

To analyze stop-loss trades and identify score patterns, we need:

1. **Wait for signals to close**: Let the bot run and check for exit conditions
2. **Enable database storage**: Ensure signals are being saved to the database
3. **Check performance tracker**: Verify the ActionPricePerformanceTracker is running
4. **Review logs**: Check if any signals are being closed but not recorded

## Next Steps

1. **Check if performance tracker is running**
   ```python
   # In main.py, verify ActionPricePerformanceTracker.start() is called
   ```

2. **Monitor for closed signals**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*), exit_reason 
   FROM action_price_signals 
   WHERE exit_reason IS NOT NULL 
   GROUP BY exit_reason;
   ```

3. **Parse JSONL for score distribution** (active signals only)
   - This can show us what scores are being generated
   - But won't tell us which scores lead to SL until signals close

## Current Status

- ✅ Signal generation working (134 signals created)
- ✅ JSONL logging working
- ❌ No closed signals yet
- ❌ Database empty (signals not persisted)
- ⏳ Need to wait for exits to analyze SL patterns

---

**Recommendation**: Check the bot's performance tracker status and logs to understand why signals aren't being saved to the database or closed.
